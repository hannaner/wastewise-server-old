# Wastewise
According to the Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Department of Agriculture, food waste is estimated to be 30-40% of the entire US food supply, equating to about 219 pounds of waste per person.

To help minimize food waste, Wastewise helps you to keep track of your food items before they go bad.

No more bags of spoiled Trader Joe's spinach!
